                        Before there was technology, before there was civilization, before there was man... there were titans.
                        Millions of years ago, titans roamed the Earth, discovering the mysteries of the universe that created them,
                        until one day, they were suddenly wiped out.

                        Before the end of their existence, the wisest of the titans, Tundra, foresaw the end of his race. However, when
                        he tried to warn his comrades of their ensuing doom, they mocked him, and casted him away. Hidden, in a cold, snowy
                        landmass, he waited as armageddon wiped out everyone he knew and loved. Once the deed was done, he slept for ages...

                        Three months ago, four college students were suddenly teleported to the icy layers of Antartica. There, the large body of
                        Tundra rose from the frozen ground. There he stood, towering over the four bewildered students, thought the students did not run.

                        With a voice that could shake the heavens, he told over another apocalypse approaching soon, as well as his plan
                        to prevent it. In order to stop the end of the world, Tundra required to mind of the most brilliant men and women of the
                        human race. In response, they students created a way to bring these men and women out of hiding and save the world.

                        It became known as Tundra's Conundrum.

                        Tundra awaits, and so does your demise. Will you be chosen as the savior of the human race? Partake in the challenges ahead, and if you which,
                        add to the challenge by creating your own Conundrum rooms. The fate of the Earth is in your hands.

                        Please, save us all.
